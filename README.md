# This project is a collection of Matlab scripts that handle Compustat data. Contains the following files:

Main files for general or specific operations.
main.m
Main working file, contains a workflow of loading data and generating some action, such as processing raw compustat data, or running operations such as generating factors.
Main is currently written to load data and run stage1 regressions, but its structure is general in that many of the other scripts maintain a very similar structure.

Auxiliary files
preamble.m
## A general preabmle script that sets up variables to all direcotries and loads all lightweight auxliary files (for example trading days of NYSE stock market) + metadata for Compustat security level data:
1. company level metadata
2. security level metadata

var_types.m
# Create a dictionary for all variable types.

Important global variables:
glob:           either "g" or "na" for global/North American security data (char)
freq:           either "D" or "M: for daily/monthly data (char)
dates_CBS:      for monthly data, end of month based on CPI release data
returns_var:    the variable to use as the definition for returns (e.g. "retd" for daily regular returns, "xretd" for daily excess returns, char)
min_date:       sample start date (datetime)
max_date:       sample end date (datetime)
params:         dict containg current session global parameters (to pass to functions in one object, cotainter.Map object)
factors_tab:    mapping between factor name and the table containing it
load_in_chunks  controls procedure for fast loading of large data (bool)
T               table object containing the main data, usually cross-section security level and some additions
join TS         whether to join time series data to the cross section table, T

load_data.m
# A collection of scripts loading larger non-Compustat data, such as CPI, FX rates, and non-security Compustat data, such as company/security metadata.

load_CPI.m                  Consumer Price Index from BLS
load_currency.m             FX data
load_ex_PI.m                Expected inflation data (Cleveland model + TIPS)
load_Rf.m                   Risk free rate data
load_mkt.m                  Market index data
load_quarterly_reports.m    Quarterly financial reports (selected variables from fundq table)
full_arima.csv              ARMA(1,1) results table (generated by a Python script)
load_gvkeys.m               load security level information (typically from after some processing, sec_proc)
fpath_equity                optional: load security table in one go

merge2T.m
# script to merge different data loaded to one single table called T
# also computes book/market equity ratio (b2m)
# typically indexed on the primary keys: datadate, iid, cid etc.

# Largely unused short scripts loaded in preamble directly.
load_company.m
load_security.m
load_sechistory.m
